  <article>
    Hello! My name is Abigail and I am the creator of Cacto. Cacto is the first of many personal projects to showcase my skills in website development and design. <br>
    I have an Associate of Science degree in Computer Science, and I am a Junior college student studying Cybersecurity. It's my dream to do well in security, and to also keep up with the more creative side of computers. Feel free to contact me on Upwork with any propositions you may have!
